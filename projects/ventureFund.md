The goal of the Calvin Shindo Student Venture Fund is 1) to enrich student learning by providing a hands-on opportunity to learn the venture capital process and, 2) to nurture high potential, early-stage ventures. Student leaders learn how to make scrupulous investment decisions, negotiate, and structure transactions, all closely mimicking the real world. In addition to providing a unique educational opportunity, the Fund encourages UH entrepreneurs to give their companies a go by providing strong access to seed capital. A Fund Board made up of experienced investors oversees the investment process conducted by the student leaders.                                                                                                      

This school year, I am the Co-Chair of the fund. We're shifting the direction of the fund into 4 new goals/semester: 
1) 2+ due diligence and fund board proposals with completed investments.
2) 1+ applicants brought into PACE programs (competitions, boot-camps) via CSSVF
3) Build student pipeline pool and identify labs and groups for future partnerships
4) Improved and rigid team structure with a breadth of skills and class standing
