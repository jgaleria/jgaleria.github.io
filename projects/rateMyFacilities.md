Rate my Facilities is a website for University of Hawai'i students to rate facilities on campus such as restrooms, water fountains, and more. Functionality includes a list of all reviews, a list of all buildings on campus, a form to add a facility and review, as well as status updates. My role in this project was to create the page to list all reviews. I also helped in working out the database schema for all of our collections. From this experience, I learned more about web development and issue driven project management.
